## Description

The goal for this project was to build a hub for the games I create! A few games I created on the Scratch website and one was a simple rock paper scissors game from the coding boot camp. Very entry level stuff but it gives me the chance to keep working on my coding skills, to keep learning, and to add more to my portfolio!

The name Cartridge GG pays homage to the cartridge games I grew up playing. The "GG" mean "good game" that players usually say to each other at the end of a game.
